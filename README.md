ðŸ”¹ 1. Histogram (Basic)
What it means:
A histogram shows how many pixels in the image have a particular intensity value (from 0 to 255).

Use: To understand how dark or bright an image is.

Example:

If most pixels are near 0 â†’ image is dark.

If most pixels are near 255 â†’ image is bright.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Grayscale Histogram
What it means:
Histogram of a grayscale image (black & white).
Only one channel (no color), values from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

Use:

To analyze brightness and contrast.

Used in filtering and thresholding.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Color Histogram (RGB)
What it means:
It gives 3 histograms â€“ one for each color channel:

Red

Green

Blue

Each shows how pixel intensity is distributed in that color.

Use:

Understand color balance in an image.

Useful in image comparison and matching.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Histogram Equalization
What it means:
It's a technique to improve the contrast of an image by spreading out the most frequent intensity values.

Use:

To make dark areas lighter and bright areas more visible.

Used in medical imaging, satellite photos, etc.

ðŸ”¹ 5. CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
What it means:
Advanced version of histogram equalization. It improves contrast only in small regions (tiles) of the image and avoids over-brightening.

Use:

Works better on images with lots of small details (like face, X-rays).

Avoids noise amplification.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Real-time Histogram
What it means:
Showing histogram of a live webcam feed or video frame-by-frame.

Use:

Real-time image quality checking.

Useful in surveillance, robotics, etc.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Comparing Histograms
What it means:
Compare histograms of two images to see how similar they are.

Use:

Face recognition, object detection, duplicate image checking.

If histograms are similar â†’ images might be similar.
